We want to design a single interface for users to interact with the database and post their times for Mario Kart.

STEPS TO CONNECT MYSQL DATABASE TO HTML FORM:
- Open command line and navigate to the MarioKart Leaderboard UI folder on your local machine
  - Run command `npm init` to create a package.json file.
    - Configure the package.json file, give it a description and set the entry point as connect.js
  - Next, install node.js for MySQL package by using the command `npm install mysql` 
    - This will allow you to call on the MySQL library in order to connect the website to the MySQL Database
