Todo: work on doing some Infrastructure as Code for the database because
- the free account I'm hosting this in will expire end of March [x]
  - I want to be able to re-create it all on a new free acount easily -or- [x]
  - update the code to just put it in AWS/Azure or whatever cloud provider []
- create users (for you two and anyone else that comes along to the project) with relevant privileges []
